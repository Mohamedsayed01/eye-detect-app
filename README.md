# 🔍 Eye Disease Classification Using AI 👁️

This project aims to develop an **AI-based solution** for classifying eye diseases from retinal images. Using a dataset of retinal images, the model identifies **🩺 four types of eye diseases** with high accuracy. The project leverages state-of-the-art deep learning models, including **⚡ ResNet50**, to ensure reliable performance.

## 🚀 Project Workflow:
1. **📸 Data Collection**: I manually collected retinal images to build a suitable dataset for training.
2. **🛠️ Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and resizing images to ensure consistency.
3. **🤖 Model Development**: Training multiple models using the **fastai** library to achieve the highest accuracy.
4. **📱 Deployment & Integration**: Deploying the trained model into a **mobile application using Flutter**, with backend support via **Gradio** or **Hugging Face** for interactive predictions.

## 🏆 Key Achievements:
✅ Achieved an **impressive 91% accuracy** in classifying eye diseases.  
✅ Successfully deployed the model on platforms like **Hugging Face** and integrated it into a **Flutter-based mobile application**.

## 🔮 Future Scope:
✨ Expanding the dataset for improved accuracy and generalization.  
✨ Developing a **user-friendly interface** for seamless interaction.  
✨ Exploring **real-time image processing** for instant predictions.  

This project is designed to assist **healthcare professionals** 🏥 in diagnosing eye diseases more efficiently, **reducing manual errors** ❌ and **enhancing patient care** ❤️.
