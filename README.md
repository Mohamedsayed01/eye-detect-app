# 🔍 AI-Based Eye Disease Classification  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project aims to develop an AI-based solution for classifying eye diseases from retinal images. Using a manually collected dataset 📸, the model identifies four types of eye diseases with high accuracy. The project leverages state-of-the-art deep learning models, including **ResNet50**, to ensure reliable performance.  

## 🔄 Project Workflow  
1️⃣ **Data Collection**: images were manually gathered to build a robust dataset.  
2️⃣ **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and resizing images to ensure consistency.  
3️⃣ **Model Development**: Training multiple models using the **fastai** library to achieve the highest accuracy.  
4️⃣ **Deployment**: Integrating the trained model into a mobile application using **Flutter**, with backend support through **Gradio** or **Hugging Face** for interactive predictions.
